values ('Oyama','Over 50 years in business… Great products enter the market in a steady stream these days, but enduring products are seen less and less. Since it takes more than a great product that provides sustainability, it takes character of the owner, and true vision. Oyama carries forth the essence of this and its long-term path is clear with the Wang family intimately involved in all aspects. Here is the Oyama story. From humble beginnings the founder of Oyama, Mr. Wang has emerged as one of the leaders in the folding bike movement. The second oldest of 7 children, Mr. Wang left school early to help his mother support the family after his father, a farmer died at the age of 39 from pesticide poisoning. The odyssey into the world of bicycle manufacturing started after Mr. Wang worked as an apprentice machinist. He had a natural talent for designing and creating products. So much so, that when he left to start his own business at the age of 18, his employer told him not to compete in the same field his boss was in. Cycling components is what caught Mr. Wang’s eye, he loves R&D, and so starts his historic rise in the cycling industry, later designing and creating complete bikes. Oyama has roots in China, and means Big Mountain in Chinese. Mr. Wang realized that as a young person he had to have an older appearance to be taken seriously, so he grew a moustache, which still adorns his face today. Like so many businesses, Mr. Wang encountered challenges that forced him for a short time to close the business and return to the fields to earn money for his family. A difficult situation arose when Mr. Wang had quoted pricing to his customers according to the material costs he was originally quoted, but when it came time to manufacture, the costs more than doubled. He was in a real quandary. Fulfill the orders at the quoted price, and accept delivery from his supplier would put him out of business but be the honorable thing to do, or cancel his order and stay in business, but disrupt all the other businesses. It was a defining moment that would carve his character forever. He accepted the order and took care of everyone, causing him to return to the farm. Mr. Wang was rewarded for his integrity, when one day a client drove out by taxi to meet him at the farm and ask him to manufacture for him. The client gave Mr. Wang the money to restart his business because of his skill and character. Never again would the doors be shuttered at Oyama. Mr. Wang decided to create folders because as a component manufacturer he would not be competing with the other complete bike manufactures he was creating components for, and folders intrigued him. He saw them in Japan, but it was very rudimentary and he knew he could create something better. Now 30 years later, Oyama’s folders offer leading edge technology, with clear function and use for each model. Today Oyama employs more than 650, with family members holding key positions in the company. Customers today honor the ever-humble Mr. Wang. As a company, Oyama stands for Integrity, Quality, and Authenticity.');

values ('Dahon','History - Dahon was founded in 1982 as Hon California, Inc... After presenting his invention to several established but uninterested companies,[13] Hon and his brother Henry Hon decided to establish their own company from scratch. The two gathered venture funding and established their headquarters in Southern California while Hon relocated to Taiwan to build Dahon''s first factory. Two years later, in 1984, Dahon folding bicycles were rolling off the assembly line as one of the most compact folding bicycle on the market at that time (many will argue the Brompton Bicycle is a more compact folder). Primary production takes place in the company’s factory in Shenzhen, China. Another facility, near Beijing, produces Dahon bikes for China, an increasingly profitable market for the U.S.-based company.[15] Beginning in 2012, all Dahon brand bikes destined for Europe have been made in Bulgaria.[16] In a strategic partnership with Maxcom Ltd., the company set up a production base at one of the facilities on the continent. All of their bikes for the European market are made at the facility in Plovdiv.');

values ('Surly','Many have tried — and failed — to define Surly. Contrary to popular belief, we’re not a bunch of deranged, clown-obsessed, serial killer wannabes — well, not all of us. We’re not drunk 24/7 and we don’t live in the woods behind our office anymore. What we are is an assortment of personalities and humanoids all brought together by one common interest: bike nerdom. We make serious steel bikes for people who don’t take themselves too seriously. We don’t like to talk down to other frame materials. Instead, we’re adamant that steel is the best material for the kinds of bikes we design and ride. Our ‘Natch!’ tubesets are designed by our engineers to match the intended use and loading characteristics of each individual model. Size-specific tubesets, Custom butting profiles, proprietary forks, design details out the wazoo... all these features create the “Surly Ride” – comfort and compliance – that is consistent across all Surly bikes. Surly riders span the range of sizes and shapes while giving the finger to the principles of pinpoint marketing demographics. This isn’t some exclusive club. You’re welcome to join as long as you’re comfortable in your own skin. One thing Surly riders have in common is a penchant for cutting through bullshit. You don’t need to wear a uniform or kit to ride a Surly. Just throw your leg over and go.');
